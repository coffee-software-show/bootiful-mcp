# Bootiful MCP
 
## MCP, it's easy as ABC...

demo flow

- Claude desktop friendly stdio server (talking to https://catfacts.ninja/fact) (connects with what people know)
- it's nice because you can use graalvm and distribute native binaries for people to have on their OSes. on windows, u could distribute self-contained `catfacts.exe` binaries for people to add to their Claude Desktop .json config file. etc.
- but that means all the business logic is living on the client machine. what if there's fancy business logic living in a service somewhere? you can do that! MCP supports HTTP.
- let's refactor the STDIO service to be an HTTP service. EZ.
- but OOPS! Anthropic doesnâ€™t support the protocol that they themselves created what do we do
- create a bridge. we can create a STDIO service that in turn talks to the HTTP service. Itd be  service for Claude Desktop, but a client for our HTTP MCP service. Use Spring AI MCP client to talk to MCP service.
- and now tht the important business logic is living in an HTTP server, we have a nice opportunity to fortify the service.
- set virtual threads on the HTTP service
- add spring cloud gateway to require http basic usernames/passwords, rate limiting, and even eureka client side load balancing for numerous instances of the HTTP MCP service.
- change the bridge to talk to this new spring cloud gateway instance, configure `RestClient` to propagate username/passwords.
















MCP is a protocol by which to extend a software clients available "tools." Think of it like a plugin model, but for smart clients, like LLMs. 

In this repository we look at several scenarios. 

For these examples, I'll be assuming the final client is Claude Desktop, the macOS and Windows desktop application for Claude. 

All modules will use Java 21's virtual threads or reactive programming to ensure the easiest time scaling the system. 

All modules will use GraalVM native images. To make this trivial, I've exctracted out some Spring AOT hints to help the GraalVM native image compilation along into a module called `mcp-aot`. 

Some of these examples assume Redis is present, so there's a Docker Compose `compose.yml` in the root of this project. Run `docker compose up -d ` in the root.

## Simple STDIO MCP Service

The first example, `catfacts-stdio-mcp-service`, is a simple service that can be used with GraalVm and registered with Claude Desktop directly. It in turn acts as a client to another [webservice called CatFacts](https://catfacts.ninja).


## Simple HTTP MCP Service 

This next example, `catfacts-stdio-mcp-service`, is built using HTTP. You can inspect it using the inspector with `./inspect.sh` and then plugin `http://localhost:8080/sse` for the `URL`.

The MCP protocol supports HTTP, but Claude Desktop itself does not. So, we'll need a bridge, to act as a client to our HTTP MCP service, and a service for the Claude Desktop client, adapting STDIO to HTTP. That's `catfacts-mcp-proxy`. It'll generate a native binary that can be registerd with Claude Desktop. To use it, you'll need to export an environment variable with a username and a password on your desktop environment. if you're connecting to the HTTP MCP service directly, you'll need to specify that by overriding the `catfacts.mcp.host` property.

Our HTTP service will no doubt be overrun with eager clients and ussers, so we'll need to design the system in such a way as to be more resilient, and to reduce redundant configuration. This is the `catfacts-mcp-gateway`, which is an instance of Spring Cloud Gateway designed to centrally support Eureka-based load balancing, Redis-based rate limiting, and authentication.
